**Starter Prompt for Glaze Day Scheduler (CLI) Project**

---

I'm working on a quirky side project called **Glaze Day Scheduler (CLI)**. The idea is to help me schedule a weekly "glazing" (shout-out/celebration) for each friend in my group, making sure:
- Each friend is assigned a unique week before anyone repeats.
- No one is glazed too close to their birthday (configurable buffer, e.g., 1 week before/after).
- The schedule maximizes the distance between a friend's birthday and their glaze date.
- If a friend leaves or joins the group, the schedule can be patched: past assignments are preserved, and only future assignments are re-optimized.
- The tool should support skipping weeks, manual overrides, and possibly other features in the future.

**Tech stack:**
- Python 3
- CSV for friend list input (`name,birthday`)
- JSON for saving/loading the schedule
- Command-line interface (no web UI yet)
- Uses a greedy algorithm to maximize birthday distance for each assignment

**Example CSV:**
```
name,birthday
Alice,04-20
Bob,07-15
Charlie,12-01
```

**Example features I want to discuss or build:**
- Adding/removing friends and patching the schedule
- Skipping weeks or handling missed glazings
- Exporting/sharing the schedule
- Integrating with group chat bots or calendar reminders

**When responding, please keep in mind:**
- I want to minimize disruption to already-assigned glaze dates when patching the schedule.
- I prefer simple, readable Python code.
- Suggestions for new features or improvements are welcome!
